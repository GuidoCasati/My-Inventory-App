# Inventory App 	

## Project Overview
This app has been developed to allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app stores information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It also allows the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

## Why this Project

This project has been developed within the scope of the Android Basics Nanodegree program with the aim to produce an app with data storage features. The intent of this project is to give you practice writing raw Java code using the necessary classes provided by the Android framework. The use of external libraries is avoided.

## Highlights
- Storing information in a SQLite database
- Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
- Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
- Updating information based on user input.
- Creating intents to other apps using stored information.
